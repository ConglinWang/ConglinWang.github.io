        <div>I'm a senior student at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">
        UC Berkeley</a>. I have been curious about COMPUTERS since I was playing Medal of Honors in
         the 00s and was fortunate enough to study COMPUTERS at Berkeley.</div> 
        <br>
        <div>So I have been formally exploring COMPUTERS in college. Python. Then Java. Some iOS followed.
          C got me down to memory. Then artificial intelligence surpassed me in terms of intelligence. And 
          the exploration goes on, in the meantime of which, I travelled to 12 countries.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>Then I started in the industry doing frontend, did some tool-making in autonomous driving research, 
          and got captured by systems and backend, which I'm focusing on now.</div>

        I worked in the merchant services team during a 8-week internship 
        to build efficient, scalable, reliable and extensible Java backend 
        services that drive the mobile application used by 1,000,000+ 
        offline small businesses. Specifically, my achievements include:
      </div>
      <div class="text" style="text-align: justify">
        <div>• Designed a server-side Java application named ZMP (Z Message 
          Pivotal), a unified message-delivery engine to simplify content 
          delivery to end users. Integrated with packages including Apache 
          Commons, Lombok and Log4j to improve code maintainability and used 
          Maven to manage dependencies. Implemented design patterns including 
          factory, facade and visitor modes to make code extensible. Utilized
           Java concurrency programming, internal DevOps tools and  middleware
            including fault tolerance, message queues, distributed databases 
            for higher concurrency and availability.</div>
        <div>• Worked with teammates on the merchant VIP card project that would
           allow businesses to create customized discount plans through the 
           AliPay mobile application. Modeled the system with UML, wrote up 
           system analysis documents, performed code reviews and fixed bugs. 
           Improved test coverage to 80%+ with JUnit and Mockito.</div>

    The following are a few of the many projects I have been working on in the recent years, ranging from database, operating systems, 
    AI, and web application. Some of them have been open-sourced on Github. Hover on the titles to check out the code.

  <div class="supersubtitle">
      Gather, a Social Network Based on Geo-index and Image Recognition
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
    <div>• Designed and implemented a location-based social network web application with React JS.</div>
    <div>• Implemented features for users to create posts and browse or search for nearby posts with Ant Design,
